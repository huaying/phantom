# Phantom — Developer Guide for Claude

## What This Project Is

Phantom is a high-performance, open-source remote desktop built in Rust. Target: Parsec-class latency (~20-50ms) with DCV-class quality (pixel-perfect text), single binary deployment, browser + native access.

~18,000 lines Rust (across 6 crates), 104 tests, MIT license. Runs on Linux + Windows.

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo build --release                                    # native (WSS web transport)
cargo build --release --features webrtc                  # native + WebRTC DataChannel support
wasm-pack build crates/web --target web --no-typescript  # WASM (must run BEFORE server build!)
cargo build --release -p phantom-server                  # server embeds WASM via include_bytes!
cargo test                                               # 104 tests (unit + integration + WAN simulation)
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings                  # must be zero warnings

# GPU benchmarks (requires NVIDIA GPU + DISPLAY=:0)
DISPLAY=:0 cargo run --release -p phantom-bench          # encoder comparison: openh264 vs nvenc
DISPLAY=:0 cargo run --release --example nvenc_bench -p phantom-gpu  # GPU unit tests
```

**IMPORTANT**: WASM build order matters. Server embeds `crates/web/pkg/phantom_web_bg.wasm` via `include_bytes!`. If you change WASM code, rebuild WASM first, then server.

## Test Environment

```bash
# Docker (CPU-only):
docker build -t phantom .
docker run --rm -p 9900:9900 -p 9901:9901 -p 9902:9902/udp -e PHANTOM_HOST=127.0.0.1 phantom server-web
# → open http://127.0.0.1:9900

# Native client:
docker run --rm -p 9900:9900 phantom server
cargo run --release -p phantom-client -- --no-encrypt -c 127.0.0.1:9900

# GPU test VM (A40, driver 550, Ubuntu 24.04):
ssh horde@10.57.233.13
DISPLAY=:0 cargo run --release -p phantom-bench           # full encoder benchmark
DISPLAY=:0 cargo run --release --example nvenc_bench -p phantom-gpu  # GPU unit tests
# Server with GPU:
DISPLAY=:0 phantom-server --encoder nvenc --capture nvfbc --transport web
```

### Our 5 Unique Advantages
1. **DataChannel + WebCodecs** — same approach as Parsec/Zoom, bypasses jitter buffer (30-80ms saved)
2. **WSS fallback on same port** — WebSocket + WebCodecs as reliable fallback (validated by Helix at scale)
3. **Single binary** — web client embedded, no Docker/GStreamer/coturn needed
4. **Rust WASM code sharing** — one codebase for server + web client
5. **~17K lines** — vs KasmVNC 200K+, Neko 15K+, RustDesk 150K

### Key Lessons From Competitors
- **Parsec (BorgGames/streaming-client)**: uses DataChannel reliable+ordered for video, MSE decode. Only other production DataChannel video impl.
- **Zoom**: uses unreliable DataChannel for video, WASM decode. Validated at massive scale.
- **Neko/Selkies**: use WebRTC Media Track (RTP), not DataChannel. Browser handles decode. Simpler but 30-80ms jitter buffer.
- **Helix**: killed WebRTC entirely, uses WebSocket + WebCodecs. Reports 20-30ms lower latency than their WebRTC setup.
- **Sunshine**: no web client. Custom UDP + RTP + Reed-Solomon FEC for native Moonlight clients.
- **DCV**: QUIC transport (we have it), GPU sharing (future)
- **KasmVNC**: per-rectangle quality tracking, multi-encoder mixing, DLP features
- **RustDesk**: NAT traversal, P2P, file transfer

## Architecture Decisions (why we chose what we chose)

### No GStreamer
Direct function calls (capture → encode → send) = 0ms pipeline overhead. Sunshine and Parsec don't use GStreamer either. Our pipeline is 3 steps, not 20 elements with buffer copies.

### WebRTC DataChannel, not Media Track
Media Track adds 30-80ms jitter buffer (designed for video calls). DataChannel delivers raw bytes instantly → WebCodecs GPU decode → Canvas. Measured: 20-50ms vs 80-150ms.

### WebRTC, not WebTransport
WebTransport requires HTTPS + certificates. Self-signed ≤14 days in Chrome. Pure IP (most users) doesn't work. WebRTC works with any IP, has built-in DTLS + NAT traversal.

### HTTP POST signaling (str0m pattern)
Browser creates offer → POST /rtc → server returns answer. Single HTTP round-trip. No WebSocket signaling needed. Avoids chicken-and-egg (session must run before signaling can work).

### str0m (sans-IO WebRTC)
Pure Rust, ~15K lines, no tokio for WebRTC path. We provide UDP socket, str0m provides logic. Official `chat.rs` pattern: one socket, one run_loop, demux via `rtc.accepts()`.

**CRITICAL: str0m SCTP cannot deliver messages >16KB reliably.** Regardless of reliable/ordered settings, large DataChannel messages (e.g. 70KB H.264 keyframe) silently fail. Root cause: str0m's `ch.write()` returns `Ok(false)` when the 128KB cross-stream SCTP buffer is full, and phantom was ignoring this return value (`let _ = ch.write(...)`). Fix: proper backpressure using `set_buffered_amount_low_threshold()` + `Event::ChannelBufferedAmountLow` to pause/resume writes, with per-channel pending queues for chunks that couldn't be written immediately.

### Always H.264 full frames (tile mode removed)
Tile-based rendering (zstd per-tile) was removed — caused visual tearing when mixed with H.264 over high latency. Now every frame change triggers a full H.264 encode. TileDiffer still used to detect whether the screen changed (skips encode on static frames).

### Periodic keyframes (2s interval)
Server forces IDR keyframe every 2 seconds. Recovers from:
- WebRTC DataChannel packet loss (unreliable mode future)
- Client decoder errors
- Browser tab backgrounding/foregrounding

### Dual web transport: WSS default + WebRTC optional
- **WSS** (default): WebSocket upgrade on same HTTPS port 9900. No message size limits. Reliable. Validated by Helix as production-viable.
- **WebRTC DataChannel** (`--features webrtc` build flag, `?rtc` URL param): POST /rtc signaling, str0m 0.18, reliable+ordered. Needs chunking for messages >16KB (SCTP limitation). Only needed for future NAT traversal.
- **Native**: raw QUIC (no browser overhead, 15-30ms target)
- All produce same `Box<dyn MessageSender/Receiver>` → same session loop

---

## Key Implementation Details

### WebRTC run_loop (str0m official pattern)
- **One UDP socket** for entire server lifetime (never rebind — this was a hard bug)
- **One `run_loop` thread** managing one active client at a time
- **1ms UDP socket timeout** for responsive polling (was 50ms — caused visible lag)
- **poll_output after drain_outgoing** — flush written data immediately
- New POST /rtc → drain all pending Rtc, keep latest → replace active client immediately
- Session delivered via `Mutex<Option>` slot (always latest, stale auto-dropped)
- Bounded `sync_channel(30)` for video with `try_send` (backpressure, no blocking)
- **Chunking**: messages >16KB split into chunks before `ch.write()`. Client reassembles.

### Session reconnect (hard-won bugs)
These bugs took significant debugging. Don't reintroduce them:

1. **recv_msg() infinite spin**: MUST detect `mpsc::TryRecvError::Disconnected` and return error. Otherwise receive_loop thread spins forever, session never ends, no reconnect.

2. **Hello ordering**: Hello MUST go through video DC (same as VideoFrame). Control DC may deliver slower → decoder not configured when keyframe arrives → "Key frame is required" error.

3. **UDP socket lifecycle**: Do NOT create one socket per session. One socket for the whole server. str0m run_loop manages it. Old approach (bind/rebind per session) caused port conflicts.

4. **force_keyframe at session start**: New client needs IDR frame. Call `video_encoder.force_keyframe()` + `differ.reset()` at the top of `run_session()`.

5. **Web client got_keyframe guard**: WebCodecs throws if first frame is delta. Client skips all delta frames until first IDR arrives. Handles race condition where P-frames arrive before keyframe.

### Encoding flow
```
capture → TileDiffer (64x64 blocks) → any dirty?
  if dirty → H.264 full frame (VideoFrame)
  if static → skip encode (zero CPU)
  every 2s → force keyframe (IDR)
```
TileDiffer detects changes. If nothing changed, no encode. Hidden remote cursor means mouse movement alone = 0 dirty tiles = 0 CPU.

### Windows Service mode (Session 0 + Agent)
Architecture follows RustDesk/Sunshine pattern:
- **Service** (Session 0, LocalSystem): manages lifecycle, accepts client connections, forwards encoded frames
- **Agent** (user session): launched via `CreateProcessAsUser` with SYSTEM token (not user token — required for Winlogon desktop access on lock screen)
- **IPC**: two named pipes (`PhantomIPC_up` for frames, `PhantomIPC_down` for input) — Windows synchronous I/O deadlocks if you use a single DUPLEX pipe with concurrent read+write on the same handle
- Agent does DXGI→NVENC encoding and sends H.264 bytes over pipe (~50KB, not 8MB raw frames)
- Service uses `run_session_ipc()` which reuses `SessionRunner` for input/clipboard/keepalive/audio/stats
- On lock screen: DXGI fails → agent falls back to GDI capture + OpenH264 → auto-recovers to DXGI on unlock
- Agent calls `OpenInputDesktop()` + `SetThreadDesktop()` before capture (follows active desktop like RustDesk/Sunshine)
- `--install` / `--uninstall` for service management, `--agent-mode` for agent process

### Transport abstraction
`run_session()` takes `Box<dyn MessageSender>` + `Box<dyn MessageReceiver>`. All transports (TCP, QUIC, WebSocket, WebRTC) implement same traits. Adding new transport = new file + implement traits + one-line init change.

### GPU pipeline (crates/gpu/)
All NVIDIA libraries loaded at runtime via dlopen — compiles on any machine, GPU optional.

**NVENC encoder flow** (CPU input path):
```
Frame.data (BGRA CPU) → bgra_to_nv12 (CPU, AVX2 SIMD) → cuMemcpyHtoD → NVENC encode (GPU) → H.264 bytes
~8ms at 1080p (was ~10ms before SIMD)
```

**NVFBC→NVENC zero-copy flow** (all GPU):
```
NVFBC grab → CUdeviceptr (NV12, GPU) → NVENC encode (GPU) → H.264 bytes
~4ms at 1080p (capture 0.4ms + encode 3.5ms)
```

**CUDA context management** (hard-won lessons):
- Use `cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain` — NVFBC internally uses the primary context. `cuCtxCreate` creates a separate context that conflicts.
- NVFBC holds a context lock. Must call `NvFBCReleaseContext` before NVENC operations, `NvFBCBindContext` before NVFBC grab.
- NVENC's `encode_registered()` checks `ctx_get_current()` and only does `ctx_push` if needed (avoids double-push deadlock).

**NVFBC struct sizes** (critical):
- NVFBC embeds sizeof in the version field. Wrong size = buffer overflow = silent memory corruption.
- Verified sizes from nvfbc-sys bindgen: CreateHandleParams=40, CaptureSessionParams=64, GrabFrameParams=32, FrameGrabInfo=48.
- Use opaque byte arrays (not Rust structs with named fields) to guarantee correct sizes.

**NVFBC function loading**:
- Do NOT use `NvFBCCreateInstance` — it has strict API version checks that vary by driver.
- Instead, dlsym each function directly: `NvFBCCreateHandle`, `NvFBCToCudaGrabFrame`, etc.

**Benchmark results** (A40 GPU, 1080p, driver 550):
```
OpenH264 (CPU):           47ms  (baseline)
NVENC (CPU color conv):   10ms  (4.7x faster)
NVFBC→NVENC (zero-copy):   4ms  (12x faster)
```

**Windows benchmark** (L40 GPU, 1080p, driver 537):
```
OpenH264 (CPU capture):      6-8 fps
NVENC (CPU capture+upload):  17-18 fps
DXGI→NVENC (zero-copy):     30-47 fps (limited by 52Hz refresh rate)
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **WASM build order**: must `wasm-pack build` BEFORE `cargo build -p phantom-server`
- **Docker WebRTC**: needs `-p 9902:9902/udp` AND `-e PHANTOM_HOST=127.0.0.1`
- **str0m Receive.destination**: must match candidate_addr (127.0.0.1:9902), not socket bind addr (0.0.0.0:9902)
- **macOS Cmd key**: don't send Meta/Super to server — gets stuck after Cmd+Tab
- **Mutex poison**: use `unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())` not `.unwrap()`
- **Bounded channels**: video uses `sync_channel(30)` + `try_send` — drops on full, never blocks
- **Keepalive**: 1s ping via `sender.send_msg(Ping)` detects dead channels after browser refresh
- **XFCE Super shortcuts**: removed in Docker entrypoint (conflict with macOS Cmd)
- **NVFBC struct sizes**: must match driver's expected sizeof exactly. Use opaque byte arrays, not Rust structs.
- **NVFBC FORCE_REFRESH**: blocks on driver 550. Use NOWAIT + ensure screen activity for new frames.
- **NVFBC needs DISPLAY**: set `DISPLAY=:0` when running on remote machine. NVFBC captures X11 framebuffer.
- **NVFBC + NVENC CUDA context**: use primary context (`cuDevicePrimaryCtxRetain`), not `cuCtxCreate`. Bind/release around NVFBC↔NVENC transitions.
- **NVENC GUID by value**: `nvEncGetEncodePresetConfigEx` passes GUIDs by value, not by pointer (C ABI).
- **NVENC profile**: must use Baseline profile. OpenH264 decoder doesn't support High profile (NVENC default).
- **NVENC FORCEIDR**: value is 2 (0x2), not 4. Wrong value = keyframe never sent = client black screen.
- **Client VideoFrame decode**: must decode ALL frames sequentially, not just the last one. Keyframes get overwritten by empty P-frames in the channel buffer when encoder is fast (GPU).
- **Tile + H.264 mixed rendering**: caused visual tearing. Removed — always use H.264 full frames. Tile code still in codebase but unused.
- **HTTPS required for WebCodecs**: non-localhost HTTP is not a secure context. Server uses self-signed TLS (rcgen) for HTTPS.
- **str0m DataChannel >16KB**: SCTP silently drops large messages. MUST chunk into ≤16KB pieces. Chrome limit is 256KB but str0m fails well below that.
- **WebRTC session zombie**: after ICE disconnect, `send_msg()` swallows Full errors. Session never ends. Must detect and terminate.
- **WSS same port**: WS upgrade on HTTPS port 9900 (not separate port). Avoids self-signed cert rejection for second port.
- **HTTP query string**: strip `?ws` from path before routing, otherwise `/?ws` returns 404.
- **DXGI AcquireNextFrame timeout**: must use blocking timeout (e.g. 33ms), NOT 0. With timeout=0, capture loop misses frames between polls → 15fps instead of 30+fps.
- **DXGI refresh rate**: capture FPS capped by monitor refresh rate (DWM). RDP/headless may have low refresh (15-30Hz). Check with `wmic path Win32_VideoController get CurrentRefreshRate`.
- **WS disconnect under high bandwidth**: TLS write can exceed read timeout → tungstenite interprets as error. Increased timeout from 5ms to 50ms.
- **Stuck modifier keys**: Super/Meta (macOS Cmd) gets stuck on server after Cmd+Tab. Server releases all modifiers on session start. Client does NOT send Super/Meta, releases modifiers on focus loss.
- **NVENC SPS/PPS**: NVENC only outputs SPS/PPS on first encode after `nvEncInitializeEncoder()`. `force_keyframe()` produces IDR without SPS/PPS. Fix: server saves SPS/PPS from first keyframe and prepends to subsequent keyframes that lack it. Do NOT recreate encoder per session (causes CUDA context conflicts on Linux).
- **NVENC set_repeat_sps_pps offset**: offset 152 in NvEncConfig is unreliable across drivers. Driver 537 (L40) ignores it, driver 550 (A40) returns INVALID_PARAM. Do NOT use — use SPS/PPS save+prepend instead.
- **NVENC WebCodecs codec string**: must use `avc1.42c028` (Baseline Level 4.0). NVENC outputs Level 4.0 for 1080p. Previous `avc1.42001f` (Level 3.1) silently rejected 1080p (exceeds level max 720p).
- **Stale xdotool processes**: bench code spawns `xdotool mousemove` loops. Always `pkill -f xdotool` after bench testing — leftover loops send random mouse coordinates causing phantom cursor drift.
- **QUIC ALPN mismatch**: server sets `alpn_protocols = ["phantom"]` but client must also set it. Without matching ALPN, TLS handshake fails with "peer doesn't support any known protocol". Fixed in e4487ec.
- **GNOME input**: enigo (XTest) works on GNOME when no other processes interfere. Previous "GNOME broken" diagnosis was caused by stale xdotool processes, not Mutter.
- **WASM feature flag**: `--no-default-features` builds server without WASM (for GPU-only VMs without wasm-pack).
- **Windows IPC pipe deadlock**: synchronous named pipes only allow ONE pending I/O per handle. Concurrent `ReadFile` + `WriteFile` on the same DUPLEX handle deadlocks. Fix: two unidirectional pipes (`PhantomIPC_up`/`PhantomIPC_down`).
- **Windows agent SYSTEM token**: `WTSQueryUserToken` gives user token which can't access Winlogon desktop (lock screen). Use service's own SYSTEM token + `SetTokenInformation(TokenSessionId)` like Sunshine.
- **DxgiNvencPipeline SPS/PPS**: `set_repeat_sps_pps(true)` is unreliable across drivers. SPS/PPS save+prepend now built into `DxgiNvencPipeline::capture_and_encode()` itself (shared by console mode and agent mode).
- **IPC encoded frames must be sequential**: H.264 P-frames depend on previous frames. Never drain-to-latest — forward ALL queued frames in order.
- **DXGI on lock screen**: `DXGI_ERROR_KEYED_MUTEX_ABANDONED` (0x887A0026) on desktop switch. Agent must drop pipeline, switch desktop, reinit. Some drivers (L40/virtual) lose DXGI entirely until reboot — GDI fallback essential.
- **Chrome hardware WebCodecs black screen**: hardware VideoDecoder defers output callback when tab isn't fully focused (after URL navigation). Fix: use `prefer-software` for decode (~2-4ms vs ~0.5ms at 1080p, negligible vs network RTT).
- **Canvas focus required for keyboard**: without `tabindex="0"` + `canvas.focus()`, first keypresses go to browser address bar. Must auto-focus canvas on page load.
- **Cmd+R stuck keys on macOS**: Meta key is blocked but 'r' keydown is sent, page refreshes before keyup. Fix: skip ALL keys when `e.meta_key()` is true. Also release modifiers on `beforeunload` and `blur`.
- **ABR spiral on high-latency links**: previous ABR decreased bitrate whenever RTT >100ms (fixed latency). Fix: track baseline RTT (minimum observed), only decrease when RTT rises >50% above baseline (actual congestion).
- **Scroll direction**: browser `deltaY` already reflects client OS direction (macOS natural scroll). Do NOT negate. winit (native) has opposite convention from enigo — DO negate there.

## Technical Debt / Known Bugs

| Item | Severity |
|------|----------|
| ~~WebRTC session zombie~~ — fixed: ICE Disconnected → drop ActiveClient → channels disconnect → session ends | ✅ Fixed |
| ~~**str0m SCTP drops large messages**~~ — Root cause: `ch.write()` returns `Ok(false)` when buffer full, was being ignored. Fixed with proper backpressure (buffered_amount_low_threshold + pending queues). | ✅ Fixed |
| ~~**Server single-session**~~ — Fixed: session replacement implemented. New client sends doorbell, server cancels old session via AtomicBool, sends Disconnect message, old client exits cleanly. Takeover ~68ms. (PR #6, #7) | ✅ Fixed |
| ~~BGRA→YUV via `pixel_f32()` (slow per-pixel callback)~~ | ✅ Fixed — AVX2 SIMD, 2.8–3.4x speedup |
| ~~Client threads leak on reconnect (no JoinHandle tracking)~~ | ✅ Fixed — TcpShutdownHandle + shutdown(Both) on Drop |
| ~~No graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C)~~ | ✅ Fixed — ctrlc handler sets shutdown flag, cancels active session, 2s cleanup window, double Ctrl+C force exits |
| ~~HTTP handler threads unbounded (no pool)~~ | ✅ Fixed — bounded 16-thread pool + ConnGuard RAII |
| WS IO loop 50ms read timeout (was 5ms, increased for stability) | Low |
| ~~Web client no auto-reconnect~~ — fixed: exponential backoff | ✅ Fixed |
| ~~Server single-transport~~ — TCP or WSS, not both simultaneously | ✅ Fixed — `--transport tcp,web` (PR #3) |
| Mock server lacks encryption/input | Low |
| Tile code still in codebase but unused (encode_zstd, TileUpdate messages) | Low |
